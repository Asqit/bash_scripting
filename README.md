# Bash_scripting

Scripting in bash can be very useful and so it's a good thing if any type of developer knows at least the basics. Bash is both shell and also a scripting language and so you can make programs in it. This repository is suppose to help you when you get stuck. If you need to know more information about certain command, use the `man` (manual) command, e.g. `man ls`

Bash is very similar to the `lua` language by the simplicity, but bash is even more simple as it does not allow to construct big ambiguous constructs as javascripts's object, lua's table or rust's enums and structs.
